I saw this netflix documentary called "High score" (highly recommended) wich talks about the history of famous videogames, consoles, and so on,
and particularly one episode blew my mind: it was about the creation of the famous FPS Wolfenstein 3D and his brother Doom.
During the episode the creators talked about how they came up with the idea to make a 3D video game in a pc, task that have not been done before.

Got interested in the story so i decided to research a little, i don't now how they got that idea, but those guys decided to use a technique called "ray casting":

To illustrate the process of ray-casting, i created a simple maze over a standard console so our shooter can run around - no bad guys or fire arms - . 
I also uploaded some pictures to show how the maze looks like.
